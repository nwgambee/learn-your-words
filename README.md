This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Learn Your Words
For our final solo project of Mod 3, we were tasked to pick an API and make an app of our own design. I chose to use the [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/#) to create an app for Kids where they can find Vocabulary words and practice them. The user can search for a word, where they are then given the definition and part of speech (noun, verb, etc) of that word. The user can add that word to their vocab list and also practice their list by matching the word with the definition.

### Learning Goals
- Display mastery of the fundamentals of Redux, React, Router, and testing with Jest/Enzyme
- Work with and test asynchronous JavaScript functionality
- Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience

### Tech Stack
- React w/ Router 
- Redux 
- Jest & Enzyme 
- SCSS
